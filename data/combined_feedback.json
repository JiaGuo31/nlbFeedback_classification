It has been frustrating looking for books referencing the book shelf location from the NLB app. See attached for an example, the book I want to borrow is supposed to be found at Early Literacy 4-6 Junior Picture. It took a long time for me to find it because the actual shelf it was on was labelled ???????4?8??. Out of 10 books I shortlisted on my NLB app, I could only find 1 or 2 <DATE_TIME> in Punggol Regional Library. Please standardize the signages to the NLB app records. The staff I approached also tried their best but I could see they were also confused a lot of times about which shelf the app was referring to. I also found out that because some shelves were full, 2 of those books marked available in the app, were actually not put on the shelves but in storage. In particular the Hanyu Pinyin section. Please look into the Hanyu Pinyin section. Thanks. Aside from my feedback, please keep up with the good work you are doing for the literacy of our nation."

If the feedback is understood, it should be clear it isn't conflicting with equitable availability of resources. Thus it does not explain why the borrower was not afforded the opportunity to extend the borrowing period, resulting in immediate overdue charges. The borrower is already allowed renewal and there is no reservation in question. The replies seems to constantly brushing aside the feedback without properly understanding them. There are flaws in the current processes, that seems contradictory to the principle of providing library services to patrons. I hope NLB can take a closer look at the feedback provided and address them more specifically."

Proquest does not contain local news articles. 2) NLB keeps promoting SURE campaigns but by removing factiva which contain multiple news sources both worldwide and local, patrons have lost 1 useful resource to improve information literacy. 3) Factiva database subscription is exorbitant. Only full-time students and faculty members in tertiary education get access to it. With the government promoting lifelong learning, NLB is doing a public good by providing access to quality databases for adults who've finished their tertiary education but want to continue learning. I am unsure whether the NLB staff communicating with me have used Factiva before or just replied to me based on the description on NLB website. Thealternatives like Newslink and newspapers SG only contain SPH publications. The <DATE_TIME> newspapers in newspapers sg contains pdf copies of <DATE_TIME> newspapers which have been long discontinued. Today is now a digital only publication. Factiva has current new articles from various local sources like channel news asia, sph news and today. Pressreader and SPH newspaper via NLB app are for casual readers who want to follow the news daily. It doesn't facilitate research. Factiva can search news by date, source and authors. I have attached some screenshots below. I hope someone from NLB can take the time to explore what Factiva can do rather than deciding solely based on cost benefits analysis."

By <DATE_TIME>, most of the seats were taken and reserved. These students genuinely want <SG_ADDRESS_STREET> study. However, some reserve seats for their friends <SG_ADDRESS_STREET> bags thus reducing the optimal seating capacity. May I request for NLB to initiate patrolling to allow maximum Number of Students. Both these traits in our society rear its ugly head even in the library. I am sure LKC Library knows very well that these students are here from third term school holidays until their major exams. Of course there are some Sec 3 and JC 1 students too. I hope LKC would improve the current situation."
