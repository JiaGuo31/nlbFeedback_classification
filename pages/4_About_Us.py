                1. In the main app, locate the 'Entry Feedback Form' area.
                    -   You can submit feedback in two ways:
                        -   a. Enter one feedback item at a time.
                        -   b. Copy and paste a list of feedback from Excel. Ensure each item is separated by a new line.
                    If any feedback item contains a new line, enclose it in double quotes to ensure it is treated as a single entry.
                2. Click the 'Submit' button. This may take a while depeds on how many feedback is entered. If the Cloak API is enabled, it will masked the sensitive information first before processing.
                    - *Check details below for personal information that will be anonymized*
                3. The app will generate the Category and Sub-category based on the feedback(s). It can assign more than one Categories or Sub-categories. Below is the summary of all Categories and Sub-categories

                NLB receives free-text feedback from our customers through two main sources:
                1. Responses to open-ended questions asked in our annual Customer Satisfaction Survey.
                2. Emails sent to our customer service enquiry mailbox manned by the Service Excellence Office. 
                The two sources are manually coded into categories to be sent to relevant divisions for follow-up.
                
                Both sources are currently using independent codeframes with different pre-defined actegories,\
                 making it challenging to consolidate free-text feedback across the two sources to spot common trends.\
                In order to analyse and understand this rich textual data, each source should be tagged using a common methodology,\
                saving time and costs.
